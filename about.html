<p>Started in 2009, the <strong>Geek Writers</strong> is a special interest group for writers in the central Oklahoma area. We are people who are proud to consider ourselves geeks.</p>

<p>What is a geek?</p>

<p>Traditionally the word geek has been used negatively for fools, carnival performers, or people doing 
  anything others dislike. But thanks to our ever-changing language the word has come to have a completely 
  different and rather positive meaning.</p>

<p>If you are enthusiastic about the pursuit of knowledge in a particular field, you are a geek. If you 
  throw yourself wholeheartedly into your life’s passion, you are a geek. Everyone can be considered to 
  be a geek about something; you regularly here of computer geeks, Japanese anime geeks, and coffee geeks 
  to name a few. But we here at Geek Writers are writing geeks.</p>

<p>Our passion is writing in any form: fiction, non-fiction, technical writing, freelance journalism, you 
  name it and we write it. Many of us are obsessed grammarians and avid readers. Most of us have full time 
  jobs in other fields but dabble in writing as a hobby. But the one thing we have in common:</p>

<p>We’re all geeks.</p>
