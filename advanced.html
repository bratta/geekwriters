<h3>Advanced Post Submission</h3>

<p>If you're a technical person and are not faint of heart, you can submit a blog post with the formatting and 
  any assets you want. You'll need the following tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> - This site is stored and served out of a git repository</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> account</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> with the <a href="http://gembundler.com/">bundler</a> gem installed (optional)</li>
  <li>Read up on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a> to become familiar with how this blog is setup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are ready, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://help.github.com/forking/">Fork</a> this repository: <a href="https://github.com/bratta/geekwriters">https://github.com/bratta/geekwriters</a>. This contains all the pages for the blog.</li>
  <li>Clone your new fork of the geekwriters repository:<br />
      {% highlight bash %}
      $ git clone git@github.com:yourgithubaccount/geekwriters.git
      $ cd geekwriters
      {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <li>If you have ruby installed, you can get the requirements for jekyll by doing the following:<br />
      {% highlight bash %}
      $ bundle install
      {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <li>You can create pages in the <strong>_posts</strong> directory using either <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> syntax, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a>, or HTML.
    The name of your file should look something like this: YYYY-MM-DD-title.MARKUP, where the first part is the date for your post, the title is the title of your post, and MARKUP is the markup language of your choice 
    (either markdown, textile, or html).</li>
  <li>You will need to put some metadata at the front of your post. It looks like this:
    {% highlight yaml %}
---
layout: post
title: This is a test!
author: tim
comments: true
---
    {% endhighlight %}
    Don't change "layout", but do change the title, the author, and remove the comments line if you do not want to enable commenting on your post.
    After the final dashed line, you can put the text of your post using the markup language of your choice. See the existing documents in the
    _posts directory for more detail.</li>
  <li>If you have ruby installed and ran the bundler step above, instead of creating the file yourself, you can do this:<br />
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ rake newpost
    {% endhighlight %}
    This will ask you for some basic information and create the file for you (assuming Markdown syntax) and open up the new file in your editor.
    Then all you have to do is write your content, and save the file!</li>
  <li>When you are done editing, you will need to commit your changes to git and push them up to Github:<br />
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Adding my new post"
    $ git push origin master
    {% endhighlight %}</li>
  <li>As soon as your changes are pushed up to Github, then follow the <a href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">Github guide to submitting a pull request</a>.
    This will notify me of your change and I will add your post to the site by merging in the changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this seems like a lot of work to submit a blog post. But once you get going it is really not bad at all.</p>
