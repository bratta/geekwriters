Welcome to the new blog for the Geek Writers writing group! This blog represents a complete rewrite of the old website. All data from the previous site will be purged in order to start over fresh.

Before, this site served as the meeting hub. It was used to dish out meeting reminders, inform people of the current writing prompt, and to link to all the various tools we use to keep in touch. Since then we've outgrown that solution and have moved on to something more appropriate: [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/geekwriters).

That put this site in a weird spot. If the bulk of our communication is to be centralized on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/geekwriters) instead of being spread thin across a blog, Facebook, and the mighty plethora of online social networks, then what should we do with this domain? The answer, as I see it, is to use this site to blog about the writing craft, and accept blog submissions from other members of the Geek Writers.

You'll notice up at the top right of the page a new "[Submit](http://www.geekwriters.net/submit.html)" link. You don't have to register an account, wait for approval, and go through a lot of pain to get a blog post on the web page. Instead, you can just submit via the form on the site and I will format it and post it to the blog.
