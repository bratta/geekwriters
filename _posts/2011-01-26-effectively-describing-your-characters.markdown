title: Effectively Describing Your Characters

Whenever I write a long story or a novel, I always spend a lot of time getting to know my characters. I will outline who they are down to the tiniest of details, including a wealth of material that will never even make it into the story itself. It helps me flesh out my characters and understand their motivations a lot more than if I just had a name and a general physical appearance.

The problem with this approach, however, is evident when I go back to edit my story. Often times I will see that I've spent long paragraphs describing aspects of my character. I know everything about the character and I desperately want to show, so I list off every attribute defining this character from physical attributes, idiosyncrasies, and relationships with other characters.

Take this horrible paragraph, for example:

> Henry stood at a whopping 6 feet, 5 inches in height, towering over his entire party. He had long, brown hair that was styled in natural grease. He was eclectic, aloof, and clumsy. He was prone to breaking out into song, however his deep voice was normally off-key. I wondered why he was here, but then I remembered that he was second-cousin to Jedediah, and as his only surviving family he was heir apparent to the vast fortune Jedediah amassed from his pickle farming days during the depression. Henry, however, didn't want the fortune or the fame that came with it, but instead he wanted nothing more than to settle down with Mary-Jo Pretzels and start a family as an honest radish farmer in Duluth.

The above paragraph stands to benefit from a complete rewrite. It violates every aspect of the concept of "show and tell" by telling you all there is to know about Henry instead of letting the reader explore and discover the important details along the way. It also boxes Henry in to a very well-defined persona that can't be interpreted and will be difficult to adapt and grow as the story continues. 

Here are some good ideas for describing your characters:

* Only give as much physical detail about your character as necessary.
* Use a character's dialog to help establish his or her personality.
* Physical actions taken by your character can serve as character definition.
* Describe your character from the point-of-view of another.
* Cut unnecessary life stories that do not drive the story.

Applying these principals, one potential way to rewrite our example paragraph would be like this:

> "I don't like him, Steven," Louise whispered.
>  
> "Who? Henry?" Steven asked, looking at the man stumbling and laughing in the corner. He talked with three women and a few men who were all looking up at him and laughing as he tried to tell a story.
> 
> "Yes, Henry. Why, just last night he was at the Reynolds party, completely drunk and singing along to 'Hey Jude'."
> 
> "If I recall, dear, you were there as well. And you were just as drunk and singing just as poorly."
> 
> "Yes, but at least I didn't stumble into the chandelier and fling crystal all around."
> 
> "The man can't help it. He's oafish," I explained as if it were natural.
> 
> Louise glared at Steven, who just watched in fascination at Henry, who strolled over to greet the couple.
> 
> "Hello there Steven and Louise," he said with a slight slur in his voice. 
> 
> "Ah, Henry!" Louise said in a complete change of moods. "How is your dear cousin Jedediah?"
> 
> "He is well. The pickling business is booming now so he is as happy as can be."
> 
> "Do you plan on taking over? I hear he is not long for retirement." Louise asked.
> 
> "Not if I can help it. I'm not cut out for the pickle business."
> 
> "But the money is good," Steven objected.
> 
> "Sure, the money is good. But it's just not me, you know?"

Here I am using dialog, physical actions, and the point-of-view of other characters to define Henry. Notice how this paragraph leaves some things ambiguous. Is Henry a drunk playboy? Is he a good person? It's up to the reader now to decide. I cut several details like his interest in Mary-Jo and radish farms, as well as cutting out his physical description completely as they are really not necessary, however I hinted at them. For example, the party-goers laughing with him while looking up at him should be enough to indicate his height without having to spell it out.
