<p>The Geek Writers meetings occur on the 4th Wednesday of every month at 6:30pm. 
  Currently we are holding the meetings at the <a href="http://okccoco.com/">Oklahoma City Coworking Collaborative</a> 
  in beautiful Midtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The meetings are free and we try to 
  provide snacks and drinks for everyone who comes. So if you have a love of writing 
  and consider yourself a geek about it, come on out and join us!</p>

<p>If you want to get the latest news and RSVP for our meetings, see scheduled talks, 
  participate in writing prompts, and meet the other members, check out our Meetup 
  group: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geekwriters/">http://www.meetup.com/geekwriters/</a>.</p>
